' Add notes
note right of docAI
  DocumentAIProcessor processes receipts 
  and income statements using Google 
  Document AI and outputs structured JSONs
end note

note right of historicalCSV
  Historical data is processed directly
  into tax_insights.db without going
  through Document AI
end note

note right of userTable
  Income statements update User records
  with occupation, income and tax details
end note

note right of transactionTable
  Receipts generate Transaction records
  for tax deduction analysis
end note

note right of insightsDB
  Historical enriched data provides
  context for recommendations
end note

note right of weaviateDB
  Vector database enables similarity
  search between current and historical data
end note

note bottom of resultsFile
  Final pipeline results are saved as a
  formatted text file with tax insights,
  deduction opportunities, and
  personalized recommendations
end note
