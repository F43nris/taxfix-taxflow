historicalData --> processFunction : source data
processFunction --> batchFunction : calls main function
batchFunction --> insightsDb : creates/populates
insightsDb --> fetchUsers : retrieves users
insightsDb --> fetchTransactions : retrieves transactions
fetchUsers --> addUser : loads user vectors
fetchTransactions --> addTransaction : loads transaction vectors
addUser --> weaviate : stores vectors
addTransaction --> weaviate : stores vectors
createSchema --> weaviate : defines structure

' Processing notes
note left of historicalData
  Historical CSV contains pre-enriched data
  with user profiles and transaction details
  used for training and recommendation context
end note

note bottom of batchFunction
  Processes CSV data and builds the tax_insights.db
  with enriched user and transaction information
end note

note right of insightsDb
  Contains pre-enriched data about users 
  and transactions that provides context
  for recommendations and insights
end note

note right of weaviate
  Vector database running in local Docker
  enables semantic similarity searches
  across users and transactions
end note
