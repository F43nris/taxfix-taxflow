' Main flow
transactionsDB --> vectorSearch : input users & transactions
insightsDB --> vectorSearch : historical data
insightsDB --> semanticSearch : query source
weaviate <--> vectorSearch : similarity searches
vectorSearch --> resultsProc : vector search results
semanticSearch --> resultsProc : semantic query results
resultsProc --> report : generates formatted report

' Internal vector search flow
users --> similarUsers : find similar historical users
transactions --> similarTx : find similar historical transactions
users --> txForUser : find relevant transactions for user profile

' Pipeline components
note top of vectorSearch
  Vector similarity search finds:
  1. Similar users based on profile attributes
  2. Similar transactions based on details
  3. Relevant transactions for a user profile
end note

note top of formatResults
  Processes raw search results into structured insights:
  - Deduction recommendations
  - Tax category assignments
  - Personalized user recommendations
end note

note bottom of report
  Final output is a text report with:
  - User profile summary
  - Personalized tax recommendations
  - Transaction analysis with deduction opportunities
  - Additional relevant insights
end note
